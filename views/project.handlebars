		</div>

		<p>My name is Jonathan Mariano, and I have a computer science degree from UCSD. I graduated UCSD in 2015 and I currently work as a technical consultant for Informatica's Professional Services. I plan to pursue a master's degree in the field of Human-Computer Interaction/Human Factors.</p>

		<p>I love to travel and discover new cultures and cuisines. I also love the outdoors. Camping and backpacking with my dog Moose is my absolute favorite thing to do.</p>

    <p>Below are the last two projects I designed and coded for my Human-Computer Interaction courses at UCSD. The first project, Keep San Diego Safe allows a user to select or enter a San Diego zip code and view the most common crimes in that region. A user can view the crime data in three ways. One, a word cloud displays the most prevalent crimes: the bigger the word, the more common the crime. Two, a bar graph and pie chart also present the crime data. Three, the raw data is displayed in a table at the bottom of the site.</p>

    <p>The second project, Emotion Notion is an online application to better foster "mindfulness". The user can select an emotion and write a brief description why they feel that way. Each entry is time stamped so the user can track their feelings over time.</p>

        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Project</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Keep San Diego Safe</td>
              <td>View the most prevalent crimes for a particular zip code in San Diego California.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Emotion Notion</td>
              <td>Keep track of how you feel throughout the day. Select an emotion that represents how you are feeling. Then give a brief description as to why you are feeling that emotion.</td>
            </tr>
            <!--
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>Select an emotion that represents how you are feeling.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>Give a brief description as to why you are feeling that emotion.</td>
            </tr>  -->
          </tbody>          
        </table>

		<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I hope you enjoy learning a new fact about San Diego, California through Keep San Diego Safe, and try to be a little more mindful during your day through Emotion Notion.</p>
